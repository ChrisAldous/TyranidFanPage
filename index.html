            <p> They come at you in a tide of creatures so thick a blind man could score a hit ten times out of ten.

                there will always be more, and it is our job to teach the men how to fight the ones that reach our lines.</p>

                    <p>
                        The Tyranids, also known as The Great Devourer are an extragalactic alien race, 
                        whose sole purpose is the consumption of all forms of genetic and biological 
                        material in order to evolve and reproduce. Tyranid technology is based entirely 
                        on biological engineering. Every function is carried out by living, engineered 
                        creatures, each of which collectively forms the Hive Fleet, directed by a single Hive Mind.
                    </p>
                    
                    <figure class="wrap">

                    <p>
                        The Tyranids are seen as one of the gravest threats to the entire Galaxy. 
                        They seek only to consume all organic life and cannot be reasoned with or 
                        deterred in this quest. Worse still for the Galaxy, thus far the Tyranid 
                        Hive Fleets that have been encountered are merely the furthest stretched 
                        tendril of the main invasion fleet that is still traveling in the void of space.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        The exact origin of the Tyranids themselves is unclear, save the fact that 
                        they are not of The Galaxy and have only recently arrived here after traveling 
                        countless millennia in the intergalactic void. It is unknown which galaxy they 
                        originated from, or for how long the Tyranid race has been on its genocidal 
                        rampage, but it is believed that it is the Astronomican that is drawing the 
                        Tyranid Hive Fleet to threaten the galaxy. The Tyranids were first attracted 
                        to the Milky Way Galaxy when the xenos communication device known as the Pharos 
                        was overloaded in the Battle of Sotha during the Horus Heresy. Indeed their 
                        very name is but a title given to them by the Imperium, named after the planet 
                        where they were first encountered (Tyran). It is possible that they have been 
                        preying on other galaxies since time immemorial. According to another source, 
                        they have consumed one thousand galaxies and are responsible for the annihilation of 
                        millions of intelligent species.

                        can hold.
